Scripts to fetch campaigns and other stuff from MailChimp
## About this repository
These are `bash` scripts that let us get a collection of campaigns from MailChimp and then mung through them to extract pertinent stuff.

*Note*: MailChimp limits you to 100 items per GET. For now, we're limiting the GET by date. You could loop through the collection in chunks of 50 or so. TBD.
